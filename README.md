# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## Description

In this challenge I was instructed to create a webpage from scratch. Using the proper HTML elements to construct a elaborative page to a user's eye. While creating this assignment it has taught me the tedious work of being precise with the decision making when it came down to styling the sheet. It definitely feels like there's still some cleaning up to do with the page but so far pleasntly happy with the detailed work thus far. Looking forward for progess work on the page and future assignments/learning.
